Disc Repair
===========

.. epigraph::
   This page is a tutorial on repairing scratched discs that are giving you errors such as
   Mismatching CRCs, Read Errors, Sync Errors and so on.

   This tutorial works by repairing cracks and scratches on the outer-most layer of the disc,
   preventing the laser from picking up cracks and scratches as pits or lands (data).
   This method is essentially a hand-labour version of the automated disc levelling machines.

   Once repaired by following this tutorial, you will still notice light scratches if any, but they
   shouldn't affect playback unless it damaged the inner-most layers.

.. warning::
   This tutorial is primarily aimed at CDs. Use this with caution on DVDs, HD DVDs and Blu-rays.
   The method used is only safe on CDs due to how far away the data side is from the read side of
   the polycarbonate layers. You have about half the space on DVD and HD DVD, and a 1/10th of the
   space on Blu-ray.

.. note::
   This tutorial only helps repair the read-side of the polycarbonate layer. This will not help
   fix the reflective or encoding-side polycarbonate layers at all.

   For reference, this is what a very badly decayed disc looks like, with the reflective layer
   effectively shedding like paint cracks:

   This would be an example of a disc that this method will not do anything to fix, at all.

   Full credit for this tutorial goes to BebeVentreHumide over on RED. I've rewritten the tutorial
   here for accessibility. Most text has been rewritten, some new information and images has been
   added, and is overall more friendly to those not familiar with Disc technology as a whole.

   While BebeVentreHumide didn't come up with this method, the fantastic information and images
   deserve credit.

Before we begin
---------------

You really should test this out with a scratched disc of less value or sentimental value. There's
many reasons, but the biggest is a lot of people seem to by superstition or luck, fuck the first
disc, then have high stride with the rest of the discs they try.

You also shouldn't simply believe anything a guide says, especially if it says to sand down your
disc. So try first on a test disc that means nothing to you.

If you don't have another scratched disc to try with, buy a cheap rewritable disc, burn as much
data as it can fit as to have data written to every crevice on the surface, and scratch it
intentionally. Scratch it good everywhere around the disc, like the kid borrowing your SpongeBob.

Ensure you can or can't read a file, sector, or such before you proceed. This way you know if it
actually helped or just made the disc look prettier.

What you need
-------------

    :title: What you need for Disc repair.

1. A problematic disc
2. 5 to 10 minutes
3. Clear Plastic Cleaner & Polish Solution (e.g., PlastX, 3M Scratch Remover)
4. Emery paper (Ideally 1000, 2000, and 3000 grit to alternate with)
5. A soft piece of cloth (e.g., Sponge yellow-side, paper towel, t-shirt, sock)
6. A small bowl of luke-warm water (or running water)

BebeVentreHumide got items #3 and #4 from his local Canadian Tire auto-store for a total of
$13.49, stating as enough to repair over one hundred discs.

.. tip::
    Alternatives to Meguiar's PlastX would be any similar clear plastic cleaner & polish solution.
    For example:
    - 3M Scratch Remover
    - Brasso Metal Polish

.. warning::
    Do not use any Emery/Sandpaper below 2000 grit. Even finer than 2000 would be ideal.
    Some have reported problems with less than 2000 grit, and some had issues with nothing less
    than 4000 grit.

The Repair
----------

The process is simple. Sand away the current scratches and rebuff it with clear plastic polish
solutions.

Stage 1: Sanding
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. Cut a small piece of emery paper. About the size of one side of the discs width is enough.
2. Soak the piece of emery paper in luke-warm water. Make sure it hasn't gone cold.
3. Sand the disc in straight-line motions from one edge to another edge. Do not curve your motion.

.. warning::
    While sanding, apply only light pressure on scratch-free areas. Otherwise, generally apply only
    light pressure unless theres a formidable looking scratch. When you think the scratches are
    gone, continue sanding for a minute or two.

.. warning::
    Take extra caution and go light near the inner ring of the disc data area as it holds the track
    data which is very important. If you don't have issues reading the index or contents of the
    disc then try avoid sanding it at all, or sand it very lightly with as fine grit as possible.

4. Once you you are finishing your sanding job, sand from the center near the ring outwards lightly
   but firmly in a straight line. This is said to help a lot and ultimately be very important.

Stage 2: Buffing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. Rinse the disc properly with warm water and gently dry it off with a paper towel. You should be
   left with a less glossy, less shiny disc. A matte look to it.
2. Put a few drops of solution on the CD and polish it with a small piece of cloth until the
   solution is gone.
3. Once again, rinse the disc properly with warm water and gently dry it off with a paper towel.
   You should be left with a glossy and shiny disc again.

You should now inspect the disc and see if you got rid of the scratches. Again, you may be left
with a small few light scratches, don't try to get a perfect looking disc.

Try read the disc and if it still gives you problems, carefully inspect to see if there are any
problematic scratches left. It's possible you did not sand down enough, or didn't apply enough
solution. Repeat Stage 1 and/or 2 again.

If you still have problems and it looks like some form of damage isn't going away, it is possible
big scratches could be below the outermost layer, possibly being damage on the reflective layer.

Troubleshooting Tips
-------------------------

In the original RED thread, the user SoittakaaParanoid has given the following great tips:

1. You only need a small serving of PlastX (or your similar solution).

    :title: An example of a disc with too much solution, showing how much you really need.

2. When applying PlastX (or your solution), you must push down on the disk. It does not work if you
   just smear it around and off the disc onto your desk. You must work it in.
3. If you feel a grain of material under the sandpaper, or hear the sound change, Stop sanding.
   Wash the paper and disc, then continue.
4. Sanding under running luke-warm water removes debris better.
