Terminology
===========

This page lists a few terms that you may or may not be familiar with, or may not know the full
context of.

Discs
-----

DVD
    Digital Versatile Disc, an extension of CD (Compact Disc), is a digital optical disc data
    storage medium. It can store any kind of digital data and was commonly used for DVD-Video.

DVD-Video
    A consumer video format used to store digital video on DVD discs.
    This is commonly referred to as just DVD in the context of video data.

DVD5, DVD9, DVDn...
    DVD Nomenclature based on Disc Capacity. `DVD` represents the medium, and
    the number represents the capacity. The number is generally rounded to the
    nearest whole number. `List of DVD Designations <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DVD#Capacity>`_.

DVD+/-R/W
    All formats are writable discs via burning. The "R" format is writable once whereas "RW" can be
    written to repeatedly. The "dash" and "plus" formats have differences in how they are burned
    and written, player compatability, and differ in functionality.

    In context of Remuxing, all you need to know is DVD-Video discs on these mediums are usually
    pirate discs or home made recordings via DVD recorders. Consumer DVD-Video Discs are almost
    always pressed DVD-ROM discs.

MOD
    MOD are DVD-Video discs that are made-on-demand when you purchase them. This is usually done
    by pirate disc sellers and sometimes commercially licensed discs. Nickelodeon is known to do
    this quite often for some older content on Amazon (US).

Backup Formats
--------------

DVD ISO
    A DVD or DVD-Video backed up by making a copy of the discs ISO 9660 file-system, typically
    saved with a ``.ISO`` or ``.BIN`` file extension.

DVD VIDEO_TS or VOB/IFO folder
    This refers to a DVD-Video that was backed up to a VIDEO_TS folder containing .VOB and .IFO
    files. This folder and it's files are the contents of the ISO 9660 file-system of DVD-Video
    discs.

Multiplexing
------------

Muxing
    Short for Multiplexing, Muxing is the practice of combining multiple digital data streams
    into one file. E.g., combining a H.264 and MP3 track together into one MP4 file.

Demuxing
    Demuxing is the opposite practice of Muxing, taking a combined digital data file and
    extracting it into multiple data streams.

Remuxing
    Remuxing is the practice of Demuxing then Remuxing an already muxed digital data file as
    to add or remove streams, make metadata changes, change the stream order, and more.

Formats
-------

REMUX
    A file that was Remuxed as to make improvements. A DVD REMUX more accurately represents
    the conversion of VOB (Chunked MPEG) data into a single MPEG video, with audio and other
    tracks muxed together resulting in a more accessible MP4 or MKV video file.

    All de/re/muxing processes are lossless, unless the stream data muxed was altered.

DVDRip
    A transcoded or re-encoded DVD-Video file. Often done nowadays to fix issues with a DVD that
    cannot be fixed through a REMUX. Sometimes referred to as simply `DVD` without any references
    to `REMUX` in the file name.
